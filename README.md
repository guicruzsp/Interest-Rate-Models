# Interest-Rate-Models
A notebook with codes and simulations of interest rate models (Some text was taken from Interest Rate Models - Theory and Practice, from Damiano Brigo and Fabio Mercurio)

In this code we analyze Merton’s model, Vasicek model, Dothan’s model, Brennan and Schwartz model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model (CIR), Hull-White Extended Vasicek Model and Vasicek model with two-factors version.
Moreover, we also fit Vasicek and the Hull-White to yield curve data.

Obs: For better results, increase the number of simulations.
